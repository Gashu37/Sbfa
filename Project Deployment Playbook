Turning Our Project into a Live Website1. The Code Repository: Our Single Source of TruthEvery professional project begins with a centralized code repository. We will use GitHub, the industry standard for this. Think of it as our project's secure digital library.Our Workflow:All code we write for the SBFA platform will be stored here.This is where we can track every change, so we never lose our work.It's a crucial part of our Professionalism and Trust.2. Hosting: Giving Our Website a HomeTo make our website live on the internet, we need a hosting service. This service provides the physical servers that will run our website. For a simple, professional project like ours, a service like Netlify or Vercel is perfect.Why These Services?They are free for our use case.They are designed for modern web applications.They are incredibly easy to use.3. Deployment Automation (CI/CD)This is the most efficient part of the process. We will automate the entire workflow so that every time you make a change to our code in GitHub, the website is automatically updated.The Process:CI (Continuous Integration): When you push a new code file to GitHub, the service (like Netlify) will see the change.CD (Continuous Deployment): The service will automatically build our website and publish it live to the internet.This means you never have to manually update the website. It's a completely automated system.Our Next Step: To make this a reality, we need to choose a simple hosting service and begin the deployment process.
